# Short description of this project
description: |-
  Terraform module to create a peering connection between a backing services VPC and a VPC created by [Kops](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops).

  The module depends on the following [Cloud Posse][website] Terraform modules

  - [terraform-aws-kops-metadata](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-kops-metadata) - to lookup resources within a Kops cluster
  - [terraform-aws-vpc-peering](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-vpc-peering) - to create a peering connection between two VPCs
